## Compare Identical Database Tables


</div>

### Description

Contains One Class clsCompareDB and a Demo project.

Purpose: To compare two MS Access tables in different databases.

The code alse demonstrates: ADO Technique to retrieve the Table names from an MS Access Database using the Connection Object OpenSchema Method. ADO Techniques for using a recordset to retrieve Column Name, DataType and Size.

This class came as a result of MS Access being so easy to

Change. Before I Joined Tier Technology training I was employed by the United States Navy (DP1). Our Managers decided that the MDB file should not be locked in any way. We were requested to train the users what they can do and what they shouldn't do. This gave no Guarantee though.

We had several programs that required that several tables in different databases (IE MDB's for different years) be identical in every way. The procedures in question copied information of processed information by Column Index (Column position) or by using For Each (which also relied on the Column Position). Recently I needed this technique to do some debugging on an application I wrote for Tier Technology Training. So I dug this program up. Converted it to a Class and converted all DAO code to ADO code (Just to see if I could do this). Also this allowed this class to easily be converted for use with other databases (Other than MS Access).
